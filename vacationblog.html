  <br>
<div class="container" style="max-width:750px ;">
	<p>Dreamy beaches, silky warm seas, lush scenery, and endless sunshine – these are some of the top ingredients of the ideal tropical vacation. But each destination offers its own sultry charms. Some dazzle with their natural beauty. Others add cultural attractions to the mix, with exotic customs, architecture, and mouthwatering cuisine. A few offer eco-adventures and wildlife-rich wilderness, and some sleepy islands seem to take you back in time.

Divers flock to thriving coral reefs, and surfers seek the perfect wave. It's just a matter of finding the perfect fit. From Asia to Australia and the US to the Caribbean, this list of tropical vacation hot spots covers some of the most beautiful islands in the world. You'll also find ideas for rewarding things to do and tropical places to visit for all budgets, whether you're seeking an over-the-water bungalow in Bora Bora or a bamboo hut on a Bali beach.

Design your ideal getaway with our list of the best tropical vacations.</p>

  <h1 style="color: black;">1.Maldives</h1>

  <p >Strung across the Indian Ocean southwest of India and Sri Lanka, the 26 natural atolls of the Maldives exude an almost surreal beauty. This is due, in large part, to the luminous blue waters that surround them. If slipping into the crystal-clear, soul-warming sea is a top criteria for your perfect tropical vacation, this is the place to do it – water comprises 99 percent of the Maldives. Paradoxically, it also threatens to inundate the shores of this low-lying island nation.

Male is the capital city, but most visitors head straight out to one of the remote atolls, where luxury resorts and bone-white beaches fringed by aquamarine waters await. Diving and snorkeling are world-class, and the Maldives is also a top surfing destination. The most popular surf spots are in the North and South Male Atolls..</p>
<img src="images\to1.jpg" width="100%">
Other popular things to do in the Maldives include swimming with manta rays and whale sharks, as well as big-game fishing. With water being a focal point and so many islands to choose from, the Maldives is also the perfect candidate for a cruise vacation.

<p>Bora Bora is the quintessential South Pacific paradise. This lush and dramatically beautiful island in French Polynesia rises to a sharp emerald peak ringed by an azure lagoon. Clusters of coconut palms bristle along the beaches, and luxury bungalows perch over the crystal-clear waters, some with glass floor panels, so you can peer into the thriving sea below.

While Bora Bora scores top points for natural beauty, it also ticks the box if you're seeking some cultural appeal. The official language is French, and you can taste the Gallic influence in the gourmet cuisine. Add a bevy of fun water sports, kayak trips to tiny motu (islands), picturesque hiking trails, and adventures such as shark dives, and, it's easy to see why many travelers rank pricey Bora Bora as a top honeymoon destination. It's the ultimate, once-in-a-lifetime place for a tropical vacation, and one of the best tropical vacations for couples.

<p>Wondering about the best tropical vacations on a budget? If you're looking for beautiful beaches, culture, and zesty cuisine all wrapped up with an affordable price tag, the Riviera Maya (Mayan Riviera) in Mexico is a great choice. On the tip of the Yucatán peninsula, along the Caribbean coast, the Mayan Riviera encompasses the resort destinations of Cancún, Playa del Carmen, and the island of Cozumel.

You don't have to stay at a big bustling all-inclusive resort here, though you'll find plenty fronting the long, postcard-worthy beaches. Intimate boutique hotels and yoga retreats are also in the mix.

Swimming with stingrays and dolphins diving, snorkeling, and fishing in the clear waters are popular things to do in the Riviera Maya, and culture vultures can explore the magnificent ancient ruins of Tulum, in a stunning setting above the turquoise Caribbean Sea, or Chichén Itzá, a few hours' drive away from the resort strip.

<h1 style="color: black;">4. Aitutaki, Cook Islands</h1>
 <div align="center" class="container" style="max-width:800px ;">
  <img src="images\t4.jpg" width="100%">
</div>
<br>
<div class="container" style="max-width:750px ;">
<p>Aitutaki in the Cook Islands, with close ties to New Zealand, is a dream destination for closet castaways. Blessed with a luminous aqua lagoon, lush peaks, sublime beaches bristling with palms, and some of the friendliest people in the South Pacific, Aitutaki ticks all the boxes for the perfect exotic tropical vacation.

Rarotonga is the largest of the Cook Islands, and the main tourist gateway, but Aitutaki, a 45-minute flight away, is the jewel in the crown, and that's saying plenty in an archipelago of 15 ravishing tropical isles. Swimming, snorkeling, kayaking, and fishing are all popular activities in the Cook Islands, and the island offers a window into laid-back village life, which slows to a halt on Sundays for church services.

More than 20 motu (small islands) are sprinkled around the lagoon. The small island of Tapuaetai (One Foot Island), in its southeast corner, is a popular Cook Islands day trip with a beautiful perspective of the lagoon.

If you really want to splurge, opt for a luxurious over-the-water bungalow. From here, you can paddle to your own private motu, plonk down under a palm tree, and pretend you're Robinson Crusoe for a day.

<h1 style="color: black;">5. The Mamanuca Islands, Fiji</h1>
 <div align="center" class="container" style="max-width:800px ;">

<br>
<div class="container" style="max-width:750px ;">
<p>If you're dreaming of an idyllic South Seas island bathed in sunshine, the Mamanuca Islands in Fiji fit the bill. A short boat ride from the gateway town of Nadi, this picture-perfect string of about 20 islands are popular for their gleaming palm-studded beaches, crystal-clear waters, and thriving coral reefs.

When you first glimpse these tropical beauties, it's easy to see why Survivor and the Tom Hanks movie Cast Away were filmed on islands in this chain. When choosing where to stay, your budget and interests will determine the best Fiji island for you.

Accommodation ranges from lively backpacker resorts to family-friendly hotels with thatched bures (traditional huts), and luxury hideaways like Vomo Island Resort, Likuliku Lagoon Resort, and the adults-only Tokoriki Island Resort. Popular mid-range resorts include Matamanoa Island Resort, Malolo Island Resort, Mana Island Resort, and Castaway Island.

One of the planet's top surf breaks, Cloudbreak, lies about a mile away from Tavarua Island Resort, but you can access this legendary break from other island resorts as well.

Fijians love children, so this is also a fabulous destination for families with youngsters looking to relax, and you'll find plenty of family-friendly resorts here, too.

<h1 style="color: black;">6. St. Barts, The Caribbean</h1>
 <div align="center" class="container" style="max-width:800px ;">
  <img src="images\t6.jpg" width="100%">
</div>
<br>
<div class="container" style="max-width:750px ;">
<p>If you like the glittering jet-setter scene, private villas, and pretty beaches, French-influenced St. Barts should be top on your list. But it all comes at a price.

A constant stream of visiting movie stars and mega-moguls means that accommodation and food costs more here than other destinations – especially during high season. However, in return, you'll find beautiful blond beaches backed by green hills, world-class shopping and dining, and a cultural sophistication that many other tropical destinations lack.

Like everywhere, low season offers great deals. Plus, all the beaches are public, so you can hide away in a private villa or boutique hotel and live the life of the rich and famous for less. Besides basking on the beaches, shopping, and feasting on mouthwatering continental delicacies, other popular things to do in St. Barts include snorkeling, diving, kitesurfing, kayaking, fishing, surfing, and sailing.

The top beaches are Saline Beach, Gouverneur Beach, and Lorient, and the red-roofed capital of Gustavia is one of the prettiest towns in the Caribbean.</p>
</div>

<h1 style="color: black;">7. Dominican Republic</h1>
 <div align="center" class="container" style="max-width:800px ;">

<br>
<div class="container" style="max-width:750px ;">
<p>On the eastern side of the island of Hispaniola, the Dominican Republic is a top choice for budget-minded travelers. But this popular vacation destination is much more than glorious beaches and all-inclusive resorts.

Rich in history and culture, "DR," as it's often called, also boasts some of the most diverse eco-systems in the Caribbean, with steamy jungles, deserts, mangroves, coral reefs, savanna, and soaring green peaks.

Venture away from the tourist strips of Puerto Plata, Punta Cana, and La Romana, where all-inclusive resorts cluster along idyllic sweeps of palm-fringed beach, and you'll discover a world of adventures. You can climb the highest peaks in the Caribbean, raft the white waters of the Río Yaque del Norte, hike to waterfalls through the steamy jungle, bike through pine forests along alpine trails, and explore the undeveloped beaches of the Samaná Peninsula. Cultural attractions are also a highlight.

The capital, Santo Domingo, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with charming colonial architecture and a fascinating history. But if you just want to bask on a beautiful beach, dive, swim, surf, and snorkel, you'll find plenty of opportunities to do that, too.

<h1 style="color: black;">8. Port Douglas, Australia</h1>
 <div align="center" class="container" style="max-width:800px ;">
  <img src="images\t8.jpg" width="100%">
</div>
<br>
<div class="container" style="max-width:750px ;">
<p>Port Douglas is an ideal destination for adventurous nature lovers. About an hour's drive north of Cairns in Queensland, this upscale town has evolved from its humble origins as a snoozy fishing village into a popular tropical tourist resort and a handy base for reef trips and wilderness safaris.

Two of the richest ecosystems in Australia lie a short hop from here: the Great Barrier Reef, with superb diving and snorkeling; and the Daintree Rainforest, part of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Site, which tumbles to the reef-dappled waters of Cape Tribulation.

The town's leafy streets are lined with mango trees and palms, as well as a cluster of upscale shops, cafés, and art galleries. But one of the star features of Port Douglas is Four Mile Beach, a blond crescent of jungle-fringed sand. Swimming is restricted here during marine stinger season (November through June); however, it's always a favorite spot for a stroll.

Other prime Port Douglas tourist attractions include the Wildlife Habitat and the Flames of the Forest Aboriginal Culture and Rainforest Dining Experience. Fishing trips and northbound expeditions through the rugged landscape of the Cape York Peninsula are also popular.

The winter season, from May through September, is the best time to visit, when temperatures are cooler and drier weather prevails.

<h1 style="color: black;">9. The Andaman Coast, Thailand</h1>
 <div align="center" class="container" style="max-width:800px ;">
  <img src="images\t9.jpg" width="100%">
</div>
<br>
<div class="container" style="max-width:750px ;">
<p>The Andaman Coast is a convenient base for exploring the spectacular islands of the Andaman Sea. These lush limestone peaks rise from turquoise waters, creating one of the planet's most striking seascapes.

Famous isles include the Phi Phi Islands, such as Ko Phi Phi Don, and its many resorts, and Ko Phi Phi Leh, where the Leonardo DiCaprio movie The Beach was filmed. These islands are on the popular Phuket Day Trip circuit, but you can still find your very own peaceful patch of paradise if you venture further afield. Phang Nga Bay is home to more than a hundred of these emerald beauties, including the famous James Bond Island.
<img src="images\to9.jpg" width="100%">
Popular areas to use as a base for exploring all this natural beauty are Krabi or popular Phuket, Thailand's largest island. The dazzling scenery continues inland at Khao Sok National Park, where you can commune with elephants amid the jungle-cloaked peaks.

Accommodation ranges from homestays and budget-priced beachfront bamboo shacks to luxury villa-style resorts perched on sea cliffs, but even high-end resorts tend to be more affordable here than other tropical destinations.

This is a great choice if you're looking for exotic culture, fiery food, and ravishing scenery that doesn't break the budget. Try to avoid the southwest monsoon, which usually strikes the coast from the end of May through the middle of October.</p>
</div>

<h1 style="color: black;">10. Florida Keys, USA</h1>
 <div align="center" class="container" style="max-width:800px ;">
  <img src="images\t10.jpg" width="100%">

<br>
<div class="container" style="max-width:750px ;">
<p>Home to the only coral reef in the United States, the Florida Keys offer a fun tropical fix, fantastic fishing, and a few pretty palm-lined stretches of sand. Trailing south of Miami for more than 110 miles to within about 90 miles of Cuba, the Keys are coral islands linked by causeways, so you can drive between them on the Overseas Highway, which runs from Key Largo south to Key West.

Top attractions in the Florida Keys cover nature and culture. The John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary off Key Largo offer great diving and snorkeling, and Bahia Honda State Park boasts some of the prettiest beaches. And you can't miss legendary Key West. Its anything-goes mentality complements the colorful Caribbean-style cottages and rich Hemingway history. You can also visit the southernmost tip of the United States here – it's one of the popular things to do in Key West.

Although the Florida Cays aren't necessarily one of the top beach vacations in the USA, you'll still find beautiful stretches of mostly man-made shore, and many are fronted by popular beach resorts with palm-studded grounds and views of the crystal-clear turquoise water.

Feel like fishing? Islamorada proclaims itself the "sportfishing capital of the world," with tarpon, bonefish, and permit to catch; and Marathon is also excellent for casting a line. Big-name fishing tournaments are held in the surrounding waters each year. It's also home to a number of beautiful resorts.</p>
